#Irispy Machine Learning

# Background

The goal of this repository is to test different machine learning algorithms and learn more about them. All preliminary tests of machine models will be carried out here.

#Technologies Used

I use Sci-Kit Learn and Statsmodels to get my Machine Learning Models. I use Jupyter Notebook for the testing. Other Libraries I use are: Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

#Index

1. Irispy - First Machine Learning Test. In this test I use the iris dataset to test a few of the Sci-Kit Learn classification models. The models are used are Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Naive-Bayes, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees.

2. ARIMA - In this test I used the shampoo-sales dataset located in the Resources folder. I convert it into a more clear version and use shampoo-sales1 for my model. I use the ARIMA model from statsmodels for this test. I created an ARIMA model and ran a few tests to check its accuracy.
